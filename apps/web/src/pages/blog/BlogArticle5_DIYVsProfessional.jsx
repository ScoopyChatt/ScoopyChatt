    <h2>How Much Time Does DIY Dog Waste Removal Actually Take?</h2>
    <p>
      For a household with one or two dogs, a thorough yard cleaning takes 20 to 45 minutes per week - roughly 17 to 39 hours per year, nearly a full work week spent picking up dog poop. With three dogs or a large yard, that climbs past 50 hours annually. Professional services complete the same job in 10 to 15 minutes using grid-walk methods and commercial tools, then remove the waste from your property entirely.
    </p>

    <h2>Is Picking Up Dog Poop Yourself a Health Risk?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, when done without proper precautions. Dog feces contain E. coli, Salmonella, hookworm larvae, and roundworm eggs that survive in soil for years. DIY cleanup with household tools often misses residue, leaves pathogens on gloves or shoes, and risks cross-contamination when bags tear. Professional technicians wear dedicated footwear sanitized between every yard, use commercial-grade scoopers, and double-bag all waste - significantly reducing your household's exposure to the 11 documented zoonotic pathogens in dog waste.

    <blockquote>
      "I spent every weekend managing waste until I realized how much time I was losing. It was the chore everyone in the house fought over. Professional service is worth every penny just for the peace in our household."
      <br/> - Robert M. from Soddy-Daisy

    <h2>Is Professional Pooper Scooper Service Worth the Cost in Chattanooga?</h2>
    <p>
      Scoopy Doo's weekly service starts at $20 per visit for one dog. DIY supplies - bags, scoopers that break every few months, deodorizers - cost roughly $8 to $12 per month. That leaves a gap of roughly $4 to $8 per week between professional and DIY. Against 20 to 45 minutes of labor eliminated each week, professional service costs under $0.50 per hour of time saved. For most Chattanooga households, it is one of the highest-value recurring services available.
    </p>

    <h2>What Are the Hidden Costs of DIY Waste Removal?</h2>
    <p>Most homeowners underestimate the true DIY cost:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supplies:</strong> Heavy-duty bags, scoopers replaced every 3-6 months, deodorizers - $100 to $150 per year</li>
      <li><strong>Lawn damage:</strong> Missed cleanups cause nitrogen burn patches requiring reseeding - $20 to $60 per repair</li>
      <li><strong>Inconsistency penalty:</strong> Skipped weeks compound into overwhelming sessions and higher bacterial soil contamination</li>
      <li><strong>Disposal odor:</strong> Large volumes in residential trash bins attract flies and create odor throughout summer; professional services remove waste from the property entirely</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Happens When You Miss a Week of Cleaning?</h2>
    <p>
      One skipped week with two dogs means roughly 14 to 18 new waste deposits on top of whatever was left. At Chattanooga summer temperatures above 85&deg;F, bacteria in that accumulated waste doubles every 4 hours and fly activity around deposits increases significantly within 48 hours. A two-week accumulation creates a bacterial soil load that takes additional weeks to break down even after cleanup. Professional services show up on a fixed schedule regardless of weather or your calendar, eliminating accumulation entirely.

      "We tried to do it ourselves, but we always fell behind. One week turned into three, and the yard became a disaster zone. Since hiring Scoopy Chatt, the yard is just magically clean every Thursday."

    <h2>Can You Compost Dog Waste?</h2>
    <p>
      No. Dog waste should never be composted for gardens or play areas. Unlike composted cow or horse manure, dog waste is highly acidic and contains pathogens that standard home composting temperatures cannot reliably kill. The USDA advises against using pet waste as compost unless it reaches and sustains internal temperatures above 165&deg;F - conditions that residential composters do not achieve.
