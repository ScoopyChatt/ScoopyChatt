          <p>If you have a dog, you already know the yard doesn't clean itself. But how often is often enough? The answer depends on a few key factors — and in Chattanooga's climate, the stakes are higher than in most places.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The General Rule: Once a Week Minimum</h2>
          <p>Most veterinarians and lawn care professionals agree that weekly cleanup is the baseline for a single dog. Beyond that, frequency should scale with the number of dogs, yard size, and how much time your pets spend outside. Left longer than a week, waste builds up bacteria rapidly — especially in Tennessee's warm, humid conditions.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">By Dog Count</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li><strong>1 dog:</strong> Once per week minimum</li>
            <li><strong>2 dogs:</strong> Once or twice per week</li>
            <li><strong>3+ dogs:</strong> Twice per week or more</li>
            <li><strong>Puppies:</strong> Every 2–3 days — they go far more frequently</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Chattanooga's Weather Changes the Math</h2>
          <p>With over 50 inches of rain annually and summer temperatures regularly above 85°F, Chattanooga's climate accelerates everything. Bacteria in dog waste can double in as little as four hours during hot weather. What seems manageable after a few days becomes a genuine biohazard within a week. If your kids or pets spend time in the yard, regular removal isn't optional — it's essential.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The Easiest Solution</h2>
