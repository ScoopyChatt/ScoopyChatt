          <p>Short answer: yes, absolutely. Dog waste is one of the most underestimated sources of lawn damage and health risk for Chattanooga homeowners. Despite the widespread myth that it acts as a fertilizer, dog waste is actively harmful to your grass, your soil, and your family's health.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Dog Waste Kills Grass</h2>
          <p>Unlike composted cow or horse manure, dog waste is highly acidic. Dogs are primarily carnivores, and their digestive systems produce waste with a very different chemical composition &mdash; one that burns rather than nourishes grass. The high nitrogen concentration in dog waste causes "nitrogen burn," creating the dead yellow and brown patches you may have noticed in spots your dog uses repeatedly.</p>
          <p>In Chattanooga's hot summers, this damage happens faster. Temperatures above 80°F accelerate the chemical reactions that scorch grass roots, meaning a few days of waste sitting in the same spot can kill a patch that takes weeks to recover. Consistent removal is the only way to prevent permanent damage.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The Bacteria and Pathogen Problem</h2>
          <p>The EPA classifies dog waste as a dangerous non-point source pollutant &mdash; in the same category as toxic chemicals and oil spills. A single gram of dog feces can contain up to 23 million fecal coliform bacteria, including E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter. These pathogens don't just sit on the surface. They leach into your soil and can remain viable for months or even years.</p>
          <p>Roundworm (Toxocara canis) eggs are particularly dangerous. They survive Chattanooga's mild winters and can infect humans through skin contact or accidental ingestion. Children playing in the yard &mdash; touching soil and then their faces &mdash; are at the highest risk. Hookworm larvae can also penetrate bare skin directly.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Water Runoff: Leaving Your Yard Behind</h2>
          <p>Chattanooga receives over 50 inches of rain per year. Every rainfall event carries whatever is sitting in your yard into storm drains and eventually into local waterways &mdash; including Chattanooga Creek and the Tennessee River. Dog waste in that runoff contributes E. coli, giardia, and fecal coliform to water sources used for recreation and wildlife habitat.</p>
          <p>This isn't just a personal yard problem. It's a community environmental issue that responsible pet ownership &mdash; or professional removal &mdash; directly addresses.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">How Often Does Waste Need to Be Removed?</h2>
          <p>Most yard care experts recommend at minimum once-weekly removal for households with one or two dogs. In Chattanooga's warm, wet climate, more frequent removal is better. The longer waste sits, the deeper pathogens penetrate the soil and the more extensive the grass damage becomes.</p>
          <p>For homeowners who don't have time for regular yard cleanup, Scoopy Doo's weekly and bi-weekly services keep bacteria levels low, prevent nitrogen burn, and remove waste before parasites can establish in the soil.</p>
