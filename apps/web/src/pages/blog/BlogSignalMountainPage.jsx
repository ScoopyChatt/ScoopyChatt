          <p>Signal Mountain is known for its beautiful properties, scenic views, and tight-knit community. For dog owners living on the mountain, maintaining a clean yard is a top priority - and that's exactly what Scoopy Doo delivers.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Serving Signal Mountain Dog Owners</h2>
          <p>We understand the unique landscape of Signal Mountain. From large, wooded lots to manicured suburban lawns, our team is equipped to handle yards of all sizes. We walk your property in a grid pattern to ensure no waste is left behind - no shortcuts, no missed spots.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Regular Removal Matters on the Mountain</h2>
          <p>Signal Mountain's terrain means that rainwater runoff carries bacteria from pet waste directly into the natural areas and creeks that make this community special. Proper, regular pet waste disposal protects the local environment and keeps shared green spaces safe for everyone.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Service Options for Signal Mountain Residents</h2>
          <p>We offer weekly, bi-weekly, and one-time cleanup services. Most Signal Mountain households with one or two dogs do great on our weekly plan. If you have more dogs or a smaller yard, we can customize a schedule that keeps your property consistently clean year-round - through the mountain's rainy springs, hot summers, and leafy falls.</p>
