    <h2>The Myth of Natural Fertilizer</h2>
    <p>
      Many homeowners assume that because cow manure is used as fertilizer, dog waste must be good for the grass too. Unfortunately, this is a common misconception that can quickly ruin a beautiful yard. Unlike cows, which are herbivores, dogs have a high-protein diet. This diet results in waste that is highly acidic and packed with excess nitrogen. When left on your lawn, it doesn't fertilize the grass&mdash;it burns it.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Nitrogen Burn and pH Imbalances</h2>
    <p>
      Have you noticed unsightly brown or yellow patches appearing across your lawn? That is classic nitrogen burn. While grass needs nitrogen to grow, the concentrated amount found in pet waste overwhelms the root system. It acts similarly to spilling concentrated chemical fertilizer in one spot. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the acidity of dog waste alters the pH balance of your soil over time. As the soil becomes more acidic, it creates an environment where healthy grass struggles to survive, but resilient weeds thrive. If you find yourself constantly battling weeds in areas your dog frequents, the accumulated waste is likely the culprit.
    </p>

    <h2>The Compounding Damage of Neglect</h2>
    <p>
      The longer pet waste sits on the grass, the more damage it does. Rain doesn't simply wash it away; it dissolves the waste and drives the concentrated nitrogen and acidity deeper into the soil, damaging the root system. Even after the visible waste is gone, the soil remains compromised, making it incredibly difficult to grow new grass in those spots without extensive soil remediation.
    </p>

    <h2>How Regular Pet Waste Removal Protects Your Yard</h2>
    <p>
      The most effective way to protect your lawn's health is prompt and consistent removal. By removing the waste before it has a chance to break down and leach into the soil, you prevent nitrogen burn and maintain a healthy pH balance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where professional yard maintenance becomes invaluable. A reliable pet waste removal service ensures that your yard is cleared on a consistent schedule, preventing the buildup that leads to dead spots. For homeowners in Chattanooga looking to maintain a lush, green lawn, regular scooping is just as important as mowing and watering.
