    <h2>Spring: New Beginnings and Parasite Prevention</h2>
    <p>
      As the weather in Chattanooga starts to warm up, both you and your dogs are likely spending more time outside. Spring brings beautiful blooms, but it also thaws out the ground, revealing any winter waste accumulation. This is the prime time for parasites like hookworms and roundworms to become active in the soil. Consistent waste removal during spring showers prevents hazardous runoff into local water systems and keeps your freshly growing lawn healthy. Make sure your dogs are up to date on their flea, tick, and heartworm prevention as they explore the yard.
    </p>

    <h2>Summer: Heat Management and Hydration</h2>
    <p>
      Tennessee summers are notoriously hot and humid. When dog waste bakes in the July sun, the odor can become unbearable, rendering your backyard unusable for barbecues and family gatherings. Flies and other pests are also drawn to yard waste in the summer heat. Keeping the yard completely clear of waste is essential for pest control. Additionally, always ensure your dogs have access to fresh water and deep shade, and avoid walking them on hot asphalt during peak afternoon temperatures.

      "Summer was overwhelming with the heat and trying to keep up with yard maintenance. Having Scoopy Chatt handle the waste removal gave us peace of mind, and we could actually enjoy our patio without the smell."

    <h2>Fall: Preparation for Cooler Months</h2>
    <p>
      As the leaves drop, finding pet waste becomes a frustrating game of hide-and-seek. Leaving waste hidden under layers of fallen leaves creates a breeding ground for mold and bacteria as the organic matter breaks down. It's crucial to maintain a clean yard before the heavy leaf coverage sets in. Fall is also a great time to reseed any dead patches in your grass caused by dog urine over the summer.
    </p>

    <h2>Winter: Cold Weather Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      While Chattanooga winters are generally mild, we do get freezing temperatures and occasional frost. Frozen waste is difficult to remove and acts as preserved bacteria in your yard. When the ground thaws, the accumulated mess becomes a muddy, toxic hazard. Maintaining a regular scooping schedule through the winter prevents the dreaded "spring thaw surprise." Remember to wipe your dog's paws after winter walks to remove ice-melt chemicals or salt, which can irritate their pads.
