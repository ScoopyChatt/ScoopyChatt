    {
      question: "Can you handle multiple properties?",
      answer: "Yes, we partner with large property management groups and can service multiple apartment complexes, HOA communities, and public parks across the Chattanooga area under a consolidated billing account."

    {
      question: "What is the cost for commercial accounts?",

              Managing a multi-family property or HOA comes with endless challenges. One of the most persistent and frustrating complaints property managers face? Uncollected dog waste in common areas.
            </p>

            <p>
              As more renters and homeowners prioritize pet-friendly living, the volume of dogs in managed communities is skyrocketing. While accommodating pets is great for occupancy rates, it places a heavy burden on your maintenance staff. Professional commercial pet waste removal in Chattanooga is the most effective way to protect your property value and keep residents happy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Here is how partnering with a dedicated pooper scooper service for apartments and HOAs transforms your community management experience.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Cleaner Common Areas and High Curb Appeal</h2>
            <p>
              First impressions matter. When prospective tenants tour an apartment complex, stepping over dog waste or smelling overflowing trash bins immediately turns them away. HOA pet waste removal in Chattanooga ensures that your green spaces, walkways, and entranceways remain pristine. A consistently clean environment signals to residents and visitors that the property is expertly managed.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Dramatically Fewer Resident Complaints</h2>
            <p>
              Ask any property manager: phone calls about neighbors not picking up after their dogs are exhausting. By implementing routine cleanup schedules and professional apartment dog waste station service, you proactively address the issue. When common areas are kept clean, community friction decreases, creating a more harmonious living environment for everyone.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Relief for Your Maintenance Team</h2>
            <p>
              Your on-site maintenance crew is already stretched thin handling plumbing issues, HVAC repairs, and unit turnovers. Forcing them to empty dog waste stations or walk the grounds scooping poop takes them away from high-priority tasks. Outsourcing to a professional pet waste station maintenance team allows your staff to focus on what they do best.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Advanced Sanitation and Odor Control</h2>
            <p>
              A full waste station doesn't just look bad&mdash;it creates a severe odor problem, especially during hot Tennessee summers. Professional services do more than just trash bag replacement; they include area sanitizing. We treat the stations and surrounding grass to eliminate lingering odors and neutralize harmful bacteria, ensuring the amenity remains usable and pleasant.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Enhancing the Overall Tenant Experience</h2>
            <p>
              A truly pet-friendly community goes beyond simply allowing dogs. It means providing well-maintained pet waste stations equipped with high-quality bags, clean dog parks, and safe walking paths. When residents see that management invests in comprehensive waste removal, tenant retention improves. People want to live in a community that respects both pets and sanitation.
