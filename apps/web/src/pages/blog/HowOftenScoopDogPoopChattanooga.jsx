            <p>Most veterinarians and yard care professionals recommend scooping dog poop at least once per week in Chattanooga - more often if you have multiple dogs or a small yard. Waiting longer than a week allows bacteria to multiply, parasites to establish in soil, and nitrogen burn to kill your grass. Here is exactly how often to clean up based on your household and why Chattanooga's climate makes the schedule matter more than most homeowners realize.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The Short Answer: At Least Once a Week</h2>
            <p>Most veterinarians and lawn care experts agree that once a week is the minimum for most households with one or two dogs. If you have three or more dogs, or a small yard, twice a week is better. Left any longer, waste builds up, bacteria multiply, and your yard becomes a genuine health hazard - not just an eyesore.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Chattanooga's Climate Makes Scooping More Urgent Than Most Cities</h2>
            <p>Chattanooga averages over 50 inches of rain per year - well above the U.S. average of 38 inches. Every rainfall event carries dog waste bacteria directly through storm drains into Chattanooga Creek and the Tennessee River without treatment. The pathogens involved - E. coli, Salmonella, Giardia - do not need to travel far to reach soil your family walks on.</p>
            <p>Above 80&deg;F, bacteria in dog waste doubles roughly every 4 hours. Fly populations around unremoved deposits can triple within 48 hours. Chattanooga averages more than 100 days per year above 80&deg;F - meaning summer waste left over a weekend can host a bacterial colony far larger than the original deposit by Monday morning.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">What Happens to Your Yard When You Skip a Week?</h2>
            <p>Beyond the bacteria, dog waste that sits for more than a week starts to cause other problems:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
              <li><strong>Lawn burn.</strong> Dog poop is high in nitrogen. In concentrated spots over time, it kills grass - leaving yellow and brown dead patches that are expensive to reseed.</li>
              <li><strong>Parasite eggs.</strong> Roundworms and hookworms can survive in soil for months after the waste itself has decomposed. Regular scooping removes the eggs before they have a chance to spread.</li>
              <li><strong>Odor buildup.</strong> Once waste has baked in summer heat for more than a few days, the smell embeds into the soil itself. That's hard to undo.</li>
              <li><strong>Fly attraction.</strong> Flies lay eggs in dog waste within hours. More waste means more flies around your patio, grill, and back door.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">A Simple Rule of Thumb by Dog Count</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
              <li><strong>1 dog:</strong> Once a week minimum</li>
              <li><strong>2 dogs:</strong> Once or twice a week</li>
              <li><strong>3+ dogs:</strong> Twice a week or more</li>
              <li><strong>Puppies:</strong> Every 2-3 days - they go far more frequently than adult dogs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you host outdoor events, have young children, or have neighbors whose property abuts your yard, err on the side of more frequent cleanups.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">What About Winter?</h2>
            <p>Chattanooga winters are mild compared to much of the country, but it can get cold enough that waste freezes and seems to "disappear" under leaves or frost. Don't be fooled. It's still there, and when spring thaw hits, weeks' worth of bacteria thaw right along with it. Maintaining a weekly schedule year-round is the best approach.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Don't Want to Do It Yourself? We've Got You.</h2>
