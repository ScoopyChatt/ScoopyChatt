    question: "What is Scoopy Doo and what does the service include?",
    answer: "Scoopy Doo LLC is Chattanooga's locally owned dog poop removal and pooper scooper service. Every visit includes a full grid-pattern yard sweep, double-bagged waste removal hauled off your property, gate closure, and a photo confirmation sent to you. No contracts â cancel or change anytime."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Scoopy Doo pet waste removal work?",
    answer: "It's simple: request a free quote online, we send you pricing based on yard size and number of dogs, and you pick a schedule. We show up on your day, text you when we're on the way, clean the entire yard, close your gate, and send a photo when done. Payment is handled online â no checks, no phone tag."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer a scoopy poopy service near Chattanooga, TN?",
    answer: "Yes â Scoopy Doo provides professional pooper scooper and scoopy poopy service throughout the Chattanooga metro including Hixson, Red Bank, Signal Mountain, Ooltewah, East Brainerd, Lookout Mountain, Soddy-Daisy, and North Georgia communities like Ringgold, Rossville, and Fort Oglethorpe."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I schedule dog waste removal?",
    answer: "Weekly service is our most popular option and works well for most one- or two-dog households. We also offer 2x weekly service for high-traffic yards and multiple dogs, bi-weekly for lower-use yards, and one-time cleanups if you need to start fresh before beginning a regular schedule."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Scoopy Doo dog waste removal safe for kids and pets?",
    answer: "Yes. We sanitize all scooping equipment between every yard to prevent cross-contamination. We never use harmful chemicals in your yard, and we haul all waste fully off the property. A clean yard is a safer yard â dog waste carries bacteria and parasites that are hazardous to children and other animals."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does pooper scooper service cost in Chattanooga?",
    answer: "Pricing is based on yard size and the number of dogs. Most Chattanooga homeowners pay between $15â$30 per weekly visit. The fastest way to get your exact price is to submit a free quote request â we respond the same day, usually within a few hours."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you service HOAs and apartment communities?",
    answer: "Yes. We service HOA common areas, dog-walking paths, and pet waste stations in addition to individual residential homes. We can invoice HOA boards directly and maintain visit records for compliance documentation."
