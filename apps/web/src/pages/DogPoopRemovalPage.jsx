    { question: "How much does dog poop removal cost in Chattanooga?", answer: "Weekly dog poop removal starts at $20 per visit for your first dog, with twice-weekly service from $18 per visit and bi-weekly from $33. One-time cleanups start at $85. Each additional dog is a small add-on. You will see an exact price before you commit." },
    { question: "How often should I schedule dog poop removal?", answer: "Most one and two dog homes do best with weekly visits, which keeps bacteria and odor in check and protects your lawn. Busy or multi-dog yards often prefer twice-weekly service, while smaller dogs or larger lots can work well bi-weekly." },
    { question: "Do I need to be home for service?", answer: "No. As long as we can safely access your yard, you do not need to be there. We send an on-the-way text before every visit and a photo of your secured gate when we finish." },
    { question: "What if my yard has not been cleaned in a while?", answer: "No problem. We start with a one-time initial cleanup to get your yard back to a clean baseline, then keep it that way on your regular schedule." },
    { question: "Is there a contract?", answer: "Never. There are no contracts and you can pause or cancel anytime. You stay because your yard is always clean, not because you are locked in." }

                Leaving dog waste to pile up is more than an eyesore. It carries bacteria and parasites that can harm pets and children, burns brown spots into your grass, and washes into Chattanooga creeks and rivers every time it rains. Consistent dog poop removal solves all of it, and it gives you back the time you would have spent scooping.
